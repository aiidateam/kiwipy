`kiwiPy`_ is a library that makes remote messaging using RabbitMQ (and possibly other message brokers) EASY.  It was
designed to support high-throughput workflows in big-data and computational science settings and is currently used
by `AiiDA`_ for computational materials research around the world.  That said, kiwiPy is entirely general and can
be used anywhere where high-throughput and robust messaging are needed.


Features
++++++++

* Support for `1000s of messages per second <performance_>`__
* Highly robust - no loss of messages on connection interruptions, etc., as messages are automatically persisted to disk
* Generic communicator interface with native support for RabbitMQ
* Supports task queues, broadcasts and RPC
* Support for both thread and coroutine based communication
* Python 3.8+ compatible.


Getting Started
+++++++++++++++

* To install kiwiPy follow the instructions in the `installation`_ section
* After you have successfully installed kiwipy, give in to some of the `examples`_ to see what kiwiPy can do.
* The design concepts behind kiwiPy can be found in `concepts`_ section
* If you're already familiar with `Pika`_ you might find the `coming from pika`_ section useful
* Finally check out the complete `API documentation`_
