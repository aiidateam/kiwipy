@article{Saal2013,
abstract = {High-throughput density functional theory (HT DFT) is fast becoming a powerful tool for accelerating materials design and discovery by the amassing tens and even hundreds of thousands of DFT calculations in large databases. Complex materials problems can be approached much more efficiently and broadly through the sheer quantity of structures and chemistries available in such databases. Our HT DFT database, the Open Quantum Materials Database (OQMD), contains over 200,000 DFT calculated crystal structures and will be freely available for public use at http://oqmd.org. In this review, we describe the OQMD and its use in five materials problems, spanning a wide range of applications and materials types: (I) Li-air battery combination catalyst/electrodes, (II) Li-ion battery anodes, (III) Li-ion battery cathode coatings reactive with HF, (IV) Mg-alloy long-period stacking ordered (LPSO) strengthening precipitates, and (V) training a machine learning model to predict new stable ternary compounds.},

abstract = {Recent advances in computational materials science present novel opportunities for structure discovery and optimization, including uncovering of unsuspected compounds and metastable structures, electronic structure, surface, and nano-particle properties. The practical realization of these opportunities requires systematic generation and classification of the relevant computational data by high-throughput methods. In this paper we present Aflow (Automatic Flow), a software framework for high-throughput calculation of crystal structure properties of alloys, intermetallics and inorganic compounds. The Aflow software is available for the scientific community on the website of the materials research consortium, aflowlib.org. Its geometric and electronic structure analysis and manipulation tools are additionally available for online operation at the same website. The combination of automatic methods and user online interfaces provide a powerful tool for efficient quantum computational materials discovery and characterization. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Draxl2019a,
abstract = {The Novel Materials Discovery (NOMAD) Laboratory is a user-driven platform for sharing and exploiting computational materials science data. It accounts for the various aspects of data being a crucial raw material and most relevant to accelerate materials research and engineering. NOMAD, with the NOMAD Repository, and its code-independent and normalized form, the NOMAD Archive, comprises the worldwide largest data collection of this field. Based on its findable accessible, interoperable, reusable data infrastructure, various services are offered, comprising advanced visualization, the NOMAD Encyclopedia, and artificial-intelligence tools. The latter are realized in the NOMAD Analytics Toolkit. Prerequisite for all this is the NOMAD metadata, a unique and thorough description of the data, that are produced by all important computer codes of the community. Uploaded data are tagged by a persistent identifier, and users can also request a digital object identifier to make data citable. Developments and advancements of parsers and metadata are organized jointly with users and code developers. In this work, we review the NOMAD concept and implementation, highlight its orthogonality to and synergistic interplay with other data collections, and provide an outlook regarding ongoing and future developments.},

@article{Jain2015a,
abstract = {The latest trends in high-performance computing systems show an increasing demand on the use of a large scale multicore systems in a efficient way, so that high compute-intensive applications can be executed reasonably well. However, the exploitation of the degree of parallelism available at each multicore component can be limited by the poor utilization of the memory hierarchy available. Actually, the multicore architecture introduces some distinct features that are already observed in shared memory and distributed environments. One example is that subsets of cores can share different subsets of memory. In order to achieve high performance it is imperative that a careful allocation scheme of an application is carried out on the available cores, based on a scheduling model that considers the main performance bottlenecks, as for example, memory contention. In this paper, the {\{}$\backslash$em Multicore Cluster Model{\}} (MCM) is proposed, which captures the most relevant performance characteristics in multicores systems such as the influence of memory hierarchy and contention. Better performance was achieved when a load balance strategy for a Branch-and-Bound application applied to the Partitioning Sets Problem is based on MCM, showing its efficiency and applicability to modern systems.},

@article{Pizzi2016,
abstract = {Computational science has seen in the last decades a spectacular rise in the scope, breadth, and depth of its efforts. Notwithstanding this prevalence and impact, it is often still performed using the renaissance model of individual artisans gathered in a workshop, under the guidance of an established practitioner. Great benefits could follow instead from adopting concepts and tools coming from computer science to manage, preserve, and share these computational efforts. We illustrate here our paradigm sustaining such vision, based around the four pillars of Automation, Data, Environment, and Sharing. We then discuss its implementation in the open-source AiiDA platform (http://www.aiida.net), that has been tuned first to the demands of computational materials science. AiiDA's design is based on directed acyclic graphs to track the provenance of data and calculations, and ensure preservation and searchability. Remote computational resources are managed transparently, and automation is coupled with data storage to ensure reproducibility. Last, complex sequences of calculations can be encoded into scientific workflows. We believe that AiiDA's design and its sharing capabilities will encourage the creation of social ecosystems to disseminate codes, data, and scientific workflows.},

abstract = {This paper introduces FireWorks, a workflow software for running high-throughput calculation workflows at supercomputing centers. FireWorks has been used to complete over 50 million CPU-hours worth of computational chemistry and materials science calculations at the National Energy Research Supercomputing Center. It has been designed to serve the demanding high-throughput computing needs of these applications, with extensive support for (i) concurrent execution through job packing, (ii) failure detection and correction, (iii) provenance and reporting for long-running projects, (iv) automated duplicate detection, and (v) dynamic workflows (i.e., modifying the workflow graph during runtime). We have found that these features are highly relevant to enabling modern data-driven and high-throughput science applications, and we discuss our implementation strategy that rests on Python and NoSQL databases (MongoDB). Finally, we present performance data and limitations of our approach along with planned future work.},
